      "Translation of Human Umbilical Cord Blood Derived Stem Cells to the Clinic for Treating Stroke",
    abstract:
      "Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) is a rich source of stem cells that has been evaluated for the treatment of various disorders and diseases.We have isolated a CD34- negative population of stem cells from hUCB that exhibits neuroprotective properties in experimental animal models of ischemic brain injury. We conducted IND-enabling studies in consultation with panel members at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order to translate our non-hematopoietic umbilical cord blood stem cells (nhUCBSCs) to the clinical setting. We carried out toxicity, tumorigenicity, and therapeutic efficacy studies on nhUCBSCs to meet the milestones for FDA approval for a Phase I Clinical Trial. For the toxicity studies, adverse events such as seizures, respiratory distress, decreased weight, and death were monitored. Serum cytokines were monitored to determine if the administration of the cells led to systemic inflammation. For the tumorigenicity studies, karyotyping of the nhUCBSCs were conducted at different passages to assess chromosomal translocation, and telomerase activity was evaluated in nhUCBSCs. The presence of possible tumors in the various organs throughout the body of each animal was evaluated. The biodistribution of nhUCBSCs after intravenous administration was assessed. For the therapeutic efficacy studies, animals were subjected to a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and administered nhUCBSC 2 days following the ischemic brain injury. Animals treated with nhUCBSCs and vehicle controls were tested on a battery of behavioral tests after MCAO, which included the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and performances on the vertical pole. Our findings showed that there were no signs of toxicity after the administration of nhUCBSCs, including no adverse events observed and no secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Our biodistribution results showed that nhUCBSCs migrated to various organ systems at early time periods less than 48 hours. There was no evidence of tumorgenicity, in which no tumors were observed in any organ system, nor was there chromosomal translocation in nhUCBSCs. Our therapeutic efficacy studies showed that treatment with nhUCBSCs 2 days after MCAO significantly improved behavioral outcomes in both modified neurological severity scores and vertical pole tests 28 days after the ischemic event.",
